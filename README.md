#### Strategies and evaluation methods for ground global path planning based on aerial images ####

This repository contains the code and results of our research about strategies and evaluation methods for ground global path planning based on aerial images.

The modules trav and graphmap are responsible, respectively, for traversability calculation and production of traversability graphs and routes. The file examples.py contains usage examples. The file experiments.py contains code to generate results and plot graphs. The experimental data obtained after running the main experiment can be found at this [link](https://mega.nz/#!rh5DHKII!z2NkQ3BBIua61HA_OnNJ5bGQV40CHWLVUwQwbCRoiT4 "Experimental data").
